For human detection firstly I imported all the libraries required for the project. Then I initialize a HOGDescriptor which is a feature descriptor 
that extracts features from image data. It has a pre trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model that has been trained for identifying people. 
It is highly accurate and easy to use and has been trained to ignore the false positives, hence it was used. Then I open the video file I want to 
identify humans in and resize it according to my requirements. After that I define the “rectangles” which will mark the identified humans, I customize
them a bit and also create a variable that will be initialized as 0 and its count will increase as soon as a new person is identified. Then I get the 
resulting video as ‘output’ file and the detection part is complete. 
The process is very similar for vehicle detection, but just one small change. There are no good pre trained models in any feature descriptor that can 
identify vehicles. So, I use an xml file as a pre trained cascade classifier and use that to identify the features. We load up the xml file and then 
follow the same procedure as human detection. Here another change we have to introduce is after resizing the video file we have to convert it to gray 
scale as our cascade classifier works best on gray scale images. Then we create another variable with 0 as initial value, to maintain the count, create
the rectangles that mark our cars and get the resulting video as ‘output’ file. 
This concludes the working.
